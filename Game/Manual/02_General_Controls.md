# General controls

## Hand assignment
By default, the right hand is your weapon hand which holds and fires your guns, while the left hand is your off hand used for auxiliary actions. You can swap this assignment in the VR settings menu.

## Movement
Use the left thumbstick to move around. Press the thumbstick to toggle sprint - it will remain active until you press the stick again or return it to the center position. You can also physically walk in your play space.

Move the right thumbstick left or right to turn around. To jump, move the right thumbstick up. To crouch, move the right thumbstick down. You will remain crouched until you move the thumbstick upwards. To toggle between crouched and prone, move the thumbstick down again.

You can swap the functions of the left and right thumbstick by changing the movement hand in the VR settings menu.

## Interacting with the world
When you look at something you can interact with, the center of your HUD should indicate what action you can perform. Press your off hand trigger to perform the interaction.
This way, you can also pick up weapons and ammo dropped by your enemies. But keep in mind that you have to be looking at what you want to interact with, so if you are having issues, you may have to look further down or even crouch to reach those weapons.

## Activating nightvision
Bring your off hand close to your head, then press trigger to toggle nightvision.

## Using the binoculars
Press and hold your off hand's A/X button to bring up your binoculars. While active, the VR world will stop rendering, and instead the binoculars will be shown attached to your off hand. You can move your hand around and turn physically or with the right thumbstick to look around. Push the right thumbstick up or down to zoom in or out.

## Menu and objectives
Pressing the off hand's B/Y button brings up the game's menu. If you instead hold the button down, you will see an overview of your current objectives and the map of the island.
