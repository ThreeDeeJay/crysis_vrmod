# Vehicles

Crysis features a variety of vehicles that you can control.

*Note*: the vehicle controls are still fairly rudimentary at this point, and there is little in the way of comfort options for the rides. But a lot of the time, riding the vehicles is optional, so if you find them too uncomfortable or awkward, just proceed on foot.

## Entering and exiting vehicles
Approach the vehicle and, while looking at it, press the off hand trigger to enter the vehicle. To leave again, press your left hand's A/X button.

## Driving the vehicle
Use the left thumbstick to drive the vehicle. Forward/back controls your engine, while left/right steers. Left Grip can be used for a speed boost.

## Changing seats and camera mode
Press the right B/Y button to cycle through the available seats on the vehicle. Hold that button to switch between first person and third person camera.

## Firing guns
Use the right stick to aim, then press right trigger to fire your primary weapon. If the vehicle has a secondary weapon, it can be fired with the left trigger.

## VTOL controls
The left stick controls strafe movement in forward, backward, left and right direction, while the right stick controls pitch and yaw. Additionally, the right A button can be used to ascend vertically. Left Grip can be used for a speed boost.

## Recalibrate view
If you need to recalibrate your view position and height (e.g. because you want to sit down when driving vehicles), quickly hop into the menu and back into the game. This will trigger a view recalibration.
