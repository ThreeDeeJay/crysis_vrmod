# Vehicles

Crysis features a variety of vehicles that you can control.

*Note*: the vehicle controls are still fairly rudimentary at this point, and there is little in the way of comfort options for the rides. But a lot of the time, riding the vehicles is optional, so if you find them too uncomfortable or awkward, just proceed on foot.

## Entering and exiting vehicles
Approach the vehicle and, while looking at it, press the off hand trigger to enter the vehicle. To leave again, press your left hand's A/X button.

## Driving the vehicle
Use the left thumbstick to drive the vehicle. Forward/back controls your engine, while left/right steers.

## Changing seats and camera mode
Press the right B/Y button to cycle through the available seats on the vehicle. Hold that button to switch between first person and third person camera.

## Firing guns
When in the driver seat and in first person, the gun follows your head direction, so you can aim with your head. Press your weapon hand's trigger to fire the gun.

When in the gunner seat or in third person camera mode, you have to aim the gun with the right thumbstick, similar to aiming with a gamepad. Head or controller aim is unfortunately not straight-forward to implement in these situations.
