# Weapon handling

Weapons move with your weapon hand. This is the right hand by default, but you can change it to the left hand in the VR settings menu.
Press the trigger of your weapon hand to shoot. A short press of the A/X button triggers reload while a long press of the same button will cycle through the available firing modes. You can use this to switch between single and auto fire for rifles, for instance.

If you picked up two pistols, each hand will hold one pistol, and you can control and fire them individually. To switch back to a single pistol, you have to drop one pistol (see below).

*Note*: if the left hand is set as the weapon hand, the player arms will be hidden while holding the weapons. The models and animations are unfortunately not compatible with left-handed mode.

## Switching weapons
You have three different weapon slots on your body. Pistols and fists are stored in your hip slot, your standard weapons are stored over your shoulders, and explosives can be accessed on your chest or behind your back. To switch weapons, bring your weapon hand to the relevant slot location and squeeze grip to cycle through the weapons of that category.

## Dropping weapons
To drop the weapon you are holding, hold down the right thumbstick/trackpad to bring up the suit menu. Then, while the menu is still open, press your left A/X button to drop the weapon.

## Weapon accessories
You can manage your weapons' attachments through the suit functions menu. Refer to the suit abilities to find out how.

## Crosshair and aiming
You can optionally enable a "crosshair" in the VR settings. If enabled, a small sphere will be drawn indicating where your guns are aiming. Without the crosshair, you will have to rely on the weapons' iron or reflex sights.

Weapons will generally be more accurate if you are crouching or lying prone or have activated your suit's strength mode to reduce recoil.

## Two handed weapon handling
You can grab weapons with both hands to reduce spread and recoil. Bring your off hand close to the grab point, then press and hold grip on your off hand.

## Weapon scopes
If your weapon has a scope equipped, you can enable the scope mode by grabbing the weapon with both hands and then moving your weapon hand close to your head. In this mode, the VR view will deactivate, and you will instead see the scope view in front of you. You can still aim the weapon with both of your hands. Move your hand away from your head or let go with the off hand to exit the scope view.
If the scope has multiple zoom levels, you can choose between them by moving the right thumbstick up or down.

*Note*: for activating the scope view, the distance between your hand and your head matters, *not* the distance between the visible scope and the head. This may feel a bit unintuitive initially, but I don't have easy access to the actual scope's position.

## Throwing grenades
Once you have picked up some grenades, you can throw them with your weapon hand's B/Y button. Hold the button to prime the throw, then let go to throw the grenade in the direction of your weapon aim.
If you have more than one type of grenades, a short press of the B/Y button will cycle through the available grenade types.

## Handling C4
Switch to the C4 by grabbing in front of your chest or behind your back. Use your weapon hand's trigger to place C4. Press your weapon hand's A/X button to switch between the detonator and C4. With the detonator equipped, press trigger to detonate any placed C4.

## Melee attacks
To perform a melee attack, hold Grip and punch with either controller. There is a certain velocity threshold you need to cross to trigger the melee attack, which can be tweaked in the VR Settings.
Melee attacks cannot be performed while holding a weapon with both hands.
