# About Crysis VR

This mod allows you to experience Crysis as a full 6dof motion-controlled VR game. It was created by Holger "cabalistic" Frydrych with the help of the Crysis Mod SDK.

*SAVE OFTEN!*
The mod might crash at any time, so better be safe than sorry :) There is a quick save button added in the ingame menu you can use.

Also, *do not enable FSAA*. In my experience, this makes the VR mod very unstable and prone to crash. You are better off increasing the rendering resolution, instead.

The mod is and forever will be free to download and play. If you paid for getting access, you were scammed.
That being said, if you enjoyed your playtime in VR and would like to say thank you, you can leave me a tip on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fholger).

## Notes about performance

This mod is unfortunately very CPU-bottlenecked, and there is little I can do about it. Expect that you will encounter reprojection even with a very powerful CPU.

Furthermore, whenever the game switches framerates, you may experience movement to become unsmooth. Therefore, you may want to enable forced reprojection at 45 or 60 fps to get an overall smoother experience while playing.
