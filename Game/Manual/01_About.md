# About Crysis VR

This mod allows you to experience Crysis as a full 6dof motion-controlled
VR game.

## Notes about performance

This mod is unfortunately very CPU-bottlenecked, and there is little I can
do about it. Expect that you will encounter reprojection even with a very
powerful CPU.

Furthermore, whenever the game switches framerates, you may experience
movement to become unsmooth. Therefore, you may want to enable forced
reprojection at 45 or 60 fps to get an overall smoother experience
while playing.
