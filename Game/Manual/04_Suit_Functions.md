# Suit functions

Your nanosuit features a number of enhancements you can activate depending on the needs of the situation.

To access the nanosuit functions, press and hold the right thumbstick / trackpad (or the left, if you swapped the movement hand). This will open the suit menu in the HUD in front of you. Now move your weapon hand up, down, left or right to select the desired nanosuit mode, then let go of the thumbstick / trackpad.

Short press the right thumbstick / trackpad to instantly return to Armor mode.

## Weapon accessories
The bottom left tile of the suit menu brings up the weapon accessories menu where you can modify the loadout of your weapon. Here, you can for example swap out the weapon sights, attach a laser pointer or flash light and potentially select the ammo type. Press the right thumbstick / trackpad again to close the weapon menu.
